# Welcome to the UB ACM's website for 2016.

It is constructed using the [Bootstrap CSS framework](http://getbootstrap.com/) and uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for templating.

Right now, there are two branches in this repository: "master" and "2016".
"master" holds the current website, so we will not be working on it. Right now, any code edited in it will be live. Therefore, We will be working on the branch 2016.

In order to use this repository, you must:
* have git installed on your machine. Which operating system you are on will determine in what mode you will be able to use git in.
* have a text editor to edit files in. I prefer sublime text.
* understand how pull requests work. When you want to submit a change to the website, you submit a pull request (I can't just give you all permission to edit the main repository freely).
* have Jekyll installed on your computer. Note that if you do not have a Linux or Mac machine that this will make your life a lot harder.

To download the repository:

1. Go to the location that you want the folder downloaded to (ie. home/Projects/)
2. Use the command "git clone https://github.com/ubacm/ubacm.github.io.git".
3. Switch your branch to the 2016 branch by using the command "git checkout 2016".

Now you should be ready to edit the files and write some code.
